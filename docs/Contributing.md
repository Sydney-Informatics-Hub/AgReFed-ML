Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! We appreciate your interest in contributing to AgReFed-ML project. Your contributions can help improve the software and make it more useful for others.  

In this guideline, we'll explain how you can contribute to the project. Contributions to AgReFed-ML can be made in many ways, such as:

- Use-case examples via notebook contributions
- Source-code contributions
- Updating existing data source modules

## Feedback and bug reports: Create a new issue
To report bugs or provide feedback, you can use the Github Issues feature. If you spot a problem or have a suggestion for improvement, [search if an issue already exists](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/AgReFed-ML/issues). If a related issue doesn't exist, please open a new issue. The issue should address what is the current problem, where it occurs, and, if possible, one suggestion how this problem can potentially be solved. 

If this is a bug report, please  provide a clear and concise description of the issue and any relevant information
such as error messages including file name and code line, installation details, and all steps to reproduce the problem.

## Solve an open issue
Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/AgReFed-ML/issues) to find one that interests you. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a pull request with a fix.

## Use-case example notebooks
If you have an interesting use-case for this project, we would love to hear about it! A great way to demonstrate use-cases is via Jupyter notebooks, which provide helpful workflows to the community. Currently we maintain example notebooks that demonstrate some use-cases. If you make use of this package, you are welcome to contribute by improving existing notebooks or creating a Jupyter Notebook with your example and sharing it with us.

To contribute, please fork this repo and add your notebook and settings file to the folder `notebooks`. For reproducible research we encourage the use of settings YAML files (see notebooks/settings). Please give the settings file a name that corresponds to the notebook name. Then commit your changes and create a pull request to share with us.


## Documentation contributions
For small documentation changes and suggestion to improve existing documentation, please open a new Issue. If you would like to add/edit some more documentation, please fork the repo, edit the corresponding .md file, commit the change, and submit a pull request for a review.


## Source-code contributions
We welcome contributions to improve the Python code and to keep the data-source handlers up-to-date. If you have experience with Python programming and would like to contribute to the source code, we suggest the following guidelines:

1) Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.
2) Create a new branch for your changes.
3) Write clear, concise, and well-documented code.
4) Test your changes thoroughly.
5) Submit a pull request with a description of your changes and any relevant information.
