# AgReFed-ML
Machine learning tools for modelling and predicting agriculture systems and their uncertainties.

## Introduction

Agricultural soil models can be either mechanistic (e.g., soil-physics) or of data-driven, statistical nature (e.g., Probabilistic Neural Nets, Bayesian Models, Random Forests), or a combination of both (e.g., for data-driven estimation/optimisation of mechanistic model parameters and their uncertainty). The output of these models, such as spatial-temporal predictions, is used for a wide range of application (e.g., soil, yield, crops, animals). These models require inter-operable data flows of appropriately calibrated, cleaned data variables. Understanding the model limitations, assumptions and then interpreting the outputs is required. This project will contribute software scripts that provide multiple machine learning workflows and tools for agriculture researchers, with a focus on developing a software tool to map soil properties under sparse and uncertain input.

## Functionality

The core features are:

- helper functions for data pre-processing and cleaning
- generator function for of range of synthetic data with simulated spatial correlation
- automatic feature importance analysis using a multiple model approach
- spatial-temporal machine learning models for soil properties under sparse and uncertain input
- generation of prediction maps of soil properties and uncertainties
