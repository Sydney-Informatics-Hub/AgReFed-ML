### Input Specifications ###
inpath: '../../../data/Llara/bars/rescaled_csv/'
outpath: '../../../results/Llara_pointpredict_blr-gp_moisture_2021/' 
# File name with soil data and corresponding covariates
infname: 'Soilmoisture_all_covariates_weekly_2021.csv' 
# File with grid coordinates and covariates (used if predict_grid_all = True): if csv columns 'x' and 'y' represent spatial coordinates in meters,
# if shapefile or geopackage with polygon vectors, the result will be integrated over each polygon geometry.
gridname: 'grid_covariates_spatial_temporal_weekly_2021.csv'

# set project coordinate reference system
project_crs: "EPSG:28355" 

# Name of target for prediction (column name in dataframe)
name_target: 'D1'

# Choose model function, currently implemented:
#'blr': bayesian linear regression with power transformation
#'rf': Random Forest Regression
#'blr-gp' Gaussian Process with bayesian linear regression as mean function
#'rf-gp' Gaussian Process with random forest regression as mean function
model_function: 'blr-gp'

### Select spacing for prediction predictions (ideally should be same as covariate grid),
# Settings for Cube geometry that is generated (in meters)
xyvoxsize:  20 # same as grid measurements
zvoxsize: 1 # set depth resolution

# Column name for x and y coordinate
colname_xcoord: 'EASTING'
colname_ycoord: 'NORTHING'

# Is third dimension of prediction the vertical depth ('vertical') or temporal ('temporal')?
axistype: 'temporal'


### If axistype='temporal', select minimum and maximum of depth for data selection [in m]
tmin: 0 # start time for prediction
tmax: 54 # end time for prediction 

# or use only certain years for prediction (leave blank list [] if all  intervals between tmin and tmax should be considered),
# otherwise provide list of time
#list_t_pred:  [14, 27, 40] # corresponding to 2020-04-01, 2020-07-01, 2020-10-01
list_t_pred:  [13, 26, 39] # corresponding to 2021-04-01, 2021-07-01, 2021-10-01

# Column name for time coordinate
colname_tcoord: 'week'


### Spatial options for predictions, only relevant for prediction (option 'predict_new') 
# Default is point prediction if integrate_block = False and integrate_polygon = False
# number of points averaged is determined by spacing of xvoxsize, yvoxsize, zvoxsize. 
# integrate over certain volume or block size, if True specify block size in meters
integrate_block: False
xyblocksize: 20 # in meters
# temporal blocksize
tblocksize: 1


### Polygon not tested yet
# Or Calculate  prediction over polygons (only relevant for prediction: predict_new)
integrate_polygon: False
# File name of polygons to be used to average prediction (can be in any common geospatial format, e.g. shp, gpkg, geojson)
polyname: 'testpolytri.gpkg' # must be in directory inpath


### Name of covariates in soil training data (names need to match names in grid covariate file)
name_features: [
  "AVERAGE-Soil-Temp-10cm", 
  "s2_barest_earth_channel1_mean", 
  "Landscape_Topographic_wetness_index", 
  "TOTAL-Rain-Gauge", 
  "Landscape_Slope_median_300m", 
  "Landscape_MrVBF", 
  "DEM"]
